NB - Onno, I have made changes to questions 2,3,6,7,8 since first submission. I have not touched 4 and 5 as I have never been taught Fourier
analysis and I don't know how to improve it. I now have the correct upwind scheme. I think I have an issue with the Legendre polynomial as I'm
not getting the nice boundary layer. Still, I hope you can see the improvement and that I have had a better go at the analysis for the latter parts despite the issue.

Note - when the seed is set python will still print out the values of the random draw for the Legendre polynomials even though they
are not used, please ignore this.

Question 6. Set theta to 0,1 with use_legendre=False to get first figure. Than, set theta=1 and increase del_t to 0.0025 to get figure 2. Finally, reduce del_t back to 0.0001 and set use_legendre=True to get the last figure.

Question 7. First, ensure seed is set to [0.6149655,0.40498927,0.93575839] (uncomment line 102) and vary J from 100, 200, 400, while changing del_t from 0.001, 0.0005, 0.000025 respectively to get the grid refinement study. Then, set zoom to True to get remaining graphs and repeat the process of changing J and del_t using the above values to get the final figure.

Question 8.

Vary epsilon along values  0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001. Then set zoom to True and repeat to get the second figure. Make sure the seed is still
set to [0.6149655,0.40498927,0.93575839].
