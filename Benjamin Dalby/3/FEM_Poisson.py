# Method 1: construct the weak form manually by multiplying and manipulating the Poisson equation and solve the linear system

# The homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are "automatically" included, i.e. do not need anything explicit

# Method 2: generate the weak form via "derivative()" of the Ritz-Galerkin integral or variational principle and solve the nonlinear system
#

#Ju = (0.5*inner(grad(u_2),grad(u_2)) - u_2*f)*dx # f->ULF? Step 2
