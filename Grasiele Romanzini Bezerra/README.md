- In ``Exercises_1``  are all the answares for the first sheet. **The main file is the PDF report with all the answers and discussions**  ``Exercises_1/FoFD_Numerical_activity1.pdf``
The code for each question is in it designated folder, as for example the all the codes used for question 4 are in ``Exercises_1/Question4``.
The codes were written in Jupyter Notebooks and can be oppened on Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab.


- In ``Exercises_2``  are all the answares for the second sheet. **The main file is the PDF report with all the answers and discussions**  ``Exercises_2/FoFD_Numerical_activity2.pdf``
The code for each question is in it designated folder, as for example the code used for question 4 are in ``Exercises_2/codes/Q4``.

- In ``Exercises_3``  are all the answares for the third sheet. **The main file is the PDF report with all the answers and discussions**  ``Exercises_3/FoFD_Numerical_activity3.pdf``
The code used for this is in the folder ``Exercises_3/code/``.

OB: For linear problems such as advection eqns: there is no shock wave.
