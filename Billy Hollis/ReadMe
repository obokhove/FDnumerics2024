The theory for exercises 3 is found in the pdf file. In this task we used codes almost identical to those provided so they were not uploaded. 
The error plots were also found using very simple changes to the code and can be given on request.
I have also added additional detail to the theory section of the second exercise sheet and used the given code to plot a few situations. I unfortunately do not have time to re learn the finite difference content 
to appropriately modify the given code.
