FINITE VOLUME: The solutions for the finite volume part of the coursework is contained in the folder "Finite_Volume_Exercises"


Each subfolders contains the working in a .pdf format and the relevant code and graph outputs for each exercise. To produce the same graphs, simply run each code seperately. Each question is defined as a function so that you can pass different variables if required, and the variables I used to produce the graphs are mentioned in the code and pdf file.
