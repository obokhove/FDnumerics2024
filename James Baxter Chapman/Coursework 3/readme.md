Q1) Bc for Dirichlet is delta u = 0 or w=0 on boundary. Not that the normal gradient of u =0.
Q2: Matrix system required; also, the Dirichlet unknowns need to be taken off; also implying fewer equations (needed).
Q4: (dx)^(p+1), see also your table for p=1 (etc.), roughly a factor 4 reduction. h-p comparison does not quite match.
